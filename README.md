Abstract: Cultural differences are well established in non-human species. While conservation assessment typically focuses on population size, the importance of community-specific culture is starting to be recognised as a tool for conservation. We report the presence of habitual ground nesting in a newly studied East African chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) population in Uganda. We find no preliminary evidence of socio-ecological factors that would promote its use and highlight local factors that appear to make its use disadvantageous. While further study is required to establish this behaviour as meeting the strict criteria for non-human animal culture, we support the argument that the wider use of population and group-specific behavioural repertoires in flagship species, such as chimpanzees, offers a tool to promote the urgent conservation action needed to protect threatened ecosystems, including the Bugoma forest. We urge caution, however, in prioritising behavioural variants that have an impact on fitness and in employing prohibitively strict technical standards of cultural behaviour.
